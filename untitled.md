# Introduction

An electronic magazine is mainly based on the Internet, through bulletin board systems and other forms of public computer networks. Webzines are electronic magazines that are doled out through the World Wide Web. The current project points at creating an electronic magazine that will utilize the possibilities offered by the World Wide Web and that will have flexible mechanisms for creating and managing articles with a limited amount of manual processing. Nearly every major magazine and newspaper has a Web site, where either some selected or all the articles can be read. Moreover, these are offering many advantages over conventional printed magazines. Articles can be published without delay and can be instantly accessed from all over the world. Comfortable searching mechanisms and individual collections of articles, depending on the readers interests, can be provided. Interactive services like discussion groups or chat can be integrated. But one of the most important features of electronic magazines is the ability to integrate various types of media like audio, video and virtual reality \(3D\) objects. The requirements for this new electronic magazine can be divided for the functionality as seen by the reader and for the administration tool. To the reader the E-zine should offer articles that contain text as well as different kinds of multimedia elements like audio, video and 3D objects. Additional information about the authors, their affiliation and their further articles should be provided. Articles must be accessible by topic, by date, by author and via a context search. A user should be able to subscribe to the E-zine by providing a profile of his interests and should then receive a notification when matching articles are published. Electronic and networked information creation has created new opportunities for the distribution of the information products and new varieties in the kind of information that could be made available. With the advent of the World Wide Web and its transformation into a graphical medium, new possibilities for electronic magazines were created.

Types of Electronic Magazine: 

1. Online Magazines Online magazines are read online, and they aren’t formatted for a tablet and also can’t be available in an app store. Publishers of online magazines usually generate their revenue through subscribers. 

2. Online Magazine Archive or Library When we are trying to digitize the magazine into an online magazine, this makes it simple to create an online magazine archive or library. This is available through your magazine subscription website just like the original online magazine and mainly users have access to old articles.

3. Digital Magazine App It is like magazine reading digitally. In other words, this is the magazine that we can read on iPad, Kindle or tablet-like device.

4. Digital-Only Magazine App In this, we don’t include print version of magazines at all. By this, it is completely different from print media giving readers an enhanced content view.

Advantages of using electronic magazines over printed magazines: 

• Inexpensive because there are no printing or distribution costs. 

• There are no losses from unsold magazines. 

• As these magazines are distributed through the web, subscribers can receive them instantly. This process is much faster than the publishing and distribution of print catalogues. 

• These digital publications are available on readers and phones allowing for a new level of convenience. Subscribers have access to this digital content anytime anywhere. \(Atzori, 2017\)
