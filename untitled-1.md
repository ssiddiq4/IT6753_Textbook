# Method of Approach

The electronic magazine process follows some aspects of the traditional paper based but it does not include using an offset printing press to print the final product and it avoids the distribution of a physical product \(e.g., paper books, paper magazines, or paper newspapers\). Because the content is electronic, it may be distributed over the Internet and through electronic bookstores, and users can read the material on a range of electronic and digital devices, including desktop computers, laptops, tablet computers, smartphones or e-reader tablets. The consumer may read the published content online a website, in an application on a tablet device, or in a PDF document on a computer. \("Electronic publishing," 2018\) 

Ten Most Important Elements of Magazine Designing: There are several important elements in a magazine layout, such as headline, image, image caption, running head, byline, subhead, body copy, etc. Here are the ten elements that are very important for a magazine: 

1. Headline It is the most important element of a magazine layout design. It can be of various sizes but should be set in a size bigger than the other text elements in the page. A headline should be interesting, meaningful and compelling enough as it increases the chances of an article to be read.

 2. Introductory Paragraph It is the main piece of content that introduces a reader to an article and it mainly connects a reader to the main article, taking forward a reader's journey into the midst of the article and also summarizes the entire article. In terms of font size, it should be smaller than the font size of the headline of an article. But, it should be slightly bigger or at least a little bolder than the rest of the article.

 3. Body / Body Text / Body Copy This is detailed part of a magazine article when compared to the introductory paragraph. When one begins to design the magazine layout template, they should begin with designing the body copy of an article, because that takes maximum space, running into multiple paragraphs. It is important that you set the right margins in terms of columns and rows to improve readability. 

4. Bylines It is important that you acknowledge the person and the team which has worked on an article. Usually, the author's name is written under the headline of the article, which is also known as the byline. It can be written in the same font size as that of the body copy. 

5. Sub-headline / Subhead These are used to break an article into various sections or compartments, indicating what the next set of paragraphs is going to talk about. 

6. Pull Quotes These usually provide a different dimension to an article in a magazine, making it look more interesting. 

7. Captions for Images These should be written in a way that they complement the image being used in an article. A caption should describe an image and should ideally be placed immediately below the image. 

8. Section Head / Running Head Every magazine article does not need a running head, but some needs it. These are usually placed at the top of every page of a magazine and aid readers in navigating through an article easily. A running head should be designed creatively so that it looks good, because it is present on almost all pages of the magazine and a reader sees it every now and then. So, it needs to be attractive. 

9. Folio It is a way of arranging sheets of papers in your magazine, by folding them in a certain manner. 

10. Box Copy / Panel These could be statistics or dates or anything factual in nature which is important to know and short in length. Such data is placed in a box to catch the attention of a reader.
