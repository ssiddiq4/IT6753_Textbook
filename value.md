Electronic Magazines are equivalent to eNewspapers but published by established print magazine publishers. Many magazine titles such as The Economist, Times, National Geographic, and so on, have also established online websites. 

Characteristics of online magazines: 

1. Head and tail: 

One of the most important differences between websites and online magazines is the head and tail in an online magazine. Obviously, we can jump in halfway through the magazine, but there will always be a front and back cover. Most websites have a home page but there will not be an end paper. 

2. Linear navigation:

 Most websites also have a navigation structure with multiple structures. Main menus often have sub menus, and users often jump around. Online magazines only have a linear navigation. A direct and clear view will guide your readers through your articles. 

3. Full-screen experience:

Beautiful pictures and cool videos can be viewed full-screen. Enabling a full-screen mode will provide users with a more immersive, cinematic experience. Websites are often full of distracting elements like advertisements, display banners, or other subjects. Readers are far more likely to stick around longer on the pages of an online magazine, and they also tend to be more focused. 

4. Relevant content:

 The right combination of well-chosen topics, exciting headlines and visuals make a magazine worthy of reading. 

5. Visual storytelling:

Some websites are rich in visuals, although they are generally text-heavy. The ratio between text and visuals is different in online magazines, visual storytelling involves bringing text, visuals, video and audio together in one medium.

 6. Publication frequency :

A website is available 24/7 and can be updated anytime. The same applies to online magazines Readers generally have access to older issues as well. Sometimes a magazine will be a one-off edition. 

7. Push medium :

The referral link to an online magazine is very often shared via an email. We will receive this mail because we may be a customer or because we are subscribed to a newsletter. Moreover we visit a website because we are looking for it, or we may end up there by accident after clicking on any ad or a link in a tweet.
