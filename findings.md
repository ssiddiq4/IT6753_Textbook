There are several methodologies for designing and developing Web applications today. They have different strengths and weaknesses and are intended for different types of applications. One of the method is to use GitBook Version 2 which was released a few months ago and if you navigate to ‘gitbook.com’ you’ll be working in Version 2, which is not a static site generator. You can still access Version 1 by navigating to‘legacy.gitbook.com’ , Because Version 2 is not a static site generator, it can’t be hosted anywhere. Also, the legacy GitBook describes about an editor, a command line interface, and a toolchain for creating and publishing content. The product of these tools was a set of markdown and HTML that could be used anywhere. This is the most flexible part because I like to take advantage of GitHub.io and configure my GitHub.com repository to be served from GitHub.io. 

Another method is Direct publishing on the web: HTML is still the most widely used web programming language but XML is making headway and is regarded as the future direction of the Internet. XML is useful because it allows publishers to create content and data that is portable to other devices, such as handheld reading devices. Developments such as Britannica’s system of content distribution on a subscription model is making publishing more similar to television broadcasting than to traditional publishing \(Vitiello, 2001\). 

One more method is Wireless Internet/ web publishing: Wireless Internet publishing opens another avenue for the distribution of time-sensitive and compact content. This form of publishing relies on the widespread availability and continuing growth of mobile phones, PDAs and other wireless devices; these now have multimedia capabilities, including the ability to retrieve email and access information from the Internet. Wireless Internet publishing focuses on the provision of information content and value-added services in demand by wireless users who are on the move, namely the delivery of timely information and the ability to conduct transactions and inquiries with pinpoint information access from a small screen. 

Article creation: The creation of articles takes several steps in contrast to the other objects. First, heading and subheading are input, authors, contact persons and topic are selected from lists. In the second step the selected authors are assigned to their institutions. The information collected so far is sent to the Web server and stored in the database. Thus, a new article is created. 

Media files: Media files are transferred to the Web server by HTTP upload and stored in the file system. The integration of multimedia content into an EZine makes special demands on the management system. In most cases a format conversion is necessary which transforms the data supplied by the author into formats suitable for the publication in the Web. The audio and video formats produced by the user are usually defined by the tools available on his local system and often differ from the standards used for publication. The format conversion is made by the management system of the EZine, without bothering the user with it. Ideally, the user should be able to deliver data of any kind of audio and video format, which would then be automatically converted into the required format. Practically, some widely used audio and video formats can be supported. 

The reader’s view: Articles can be accessed by the readers in different ways. There are collections of articles grouped by topic and sorted by date or by author. For readers of the printed magazine there are collections which resemble the printed issues. While these are dynamically created lists, there is also the possibility to make a keyword search over all articles.
