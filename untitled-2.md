I will provide my findings to implement online magazines through world wide web. The number of scientific journals and the papers they publish keeps growing. Because a lot of this publishing only happens online, the limits to article lengths are also being adhered to less strictly. 

• We need to select a topic and find out what is the value in the market for selected topic.

 • Title should be defined by including search-engine keywords and also we can test them in google by searching and select the title accordingly.

 • Also advertising magazines via e-mail, social networking sites, discussion forums related to topic. 

• For quality online magazine, start-up costs are required which can be of higher rate. 

• Moving into eBooks and electronic distribution on demand eliminates printing and its costly consequences.

 • eInk and ePaper is expected to be the future for Electronic magazine where, eInk combines the look of ink on paper with the dynamic capability of an electronic display. In future, it is expected that eInk will allow almost any surface to become a display, bringing information off computer screens and into the world around us. Companies such as E-Ink, Phillips Components, Xerox and Advanced Display Systems are working on products for eInk and ePaper.

 • One of the largest positive factors of digital magazines is that they are not competing with print editions. It has been found through many studies that while readers do prefer digital editions, they are interested in holding on to printed versions when available. 

• With the growth of the digital industry, there are lots of applications and software that serve the purpose of simplifying the lives of publishers. For example, page flip software is example for this. The software easily converts flash files, PDF files and images into 3D pages that flip just like they would in real life.

 • Digital magazines allow more flexibility in the content that can be shared. When creating digital magazines, it is easy to change the number of pages while leaving the layout and format of the magazine as it was before but this is not possible with a printed version. 

• Publishers are able to go much farther than image and word-based content. With digital magazines it is possible to include video, flash, and images which help draw in readers in a whole new way.
